# newark-airport-delay-TOD-distribution

This is a histogram of the distribution of delayed domestic flights from Newark Airport in Jan. 2018, grouped by time of day. Data was found through the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A noticeable pattern is there is a gradual buildup of delayed flights later in the day, and a lull of delayed flights in the middle of the day. It would be interesting to compare delayed flights to the distribution of all flights to see if delayed flights buildup may be attributed purely to the amount of flights departing at that time of day.
